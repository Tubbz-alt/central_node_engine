# In this file the desired target architectures
# as well as toolchain paths and prefixes are
# defined.
#
# The names for target architectures can be picked
# arbitrarily but should not characters besides
# [0-9][a-z][A-Z][.][-][_]

# By default the 'host' architecture is built. But
# you can redefine the name of the host architecture:
# HARCH = www
HARCH=linux-x86_64

# Assuming you also want 'xxx' and 'yyy' then you'd
# add these to the 'ARCHES' variable:

# ARCHES += xxx yyy

# Uncomment this to build for linuxRT
ARCHES += linuxRT-x86_64

# Next, you need to define prefixes (which may include
# absolute paths) so that e.g., $(CROSS_xxx)gcc can be
# used as a C compiler, e.g.:
BR_VERSION=2015.02

BR_PATH=/afs/slac/package/linuxRT/buildroot-$(BR_VERSION)/host/$(HARCH)/$(1)/usr/bin/$(1)-linux-

# CROSS_xxx = path_to_xxx_tools/xxx-
# CROSS_yyy = path_to_yyy_tools/yyy-
#
CROSS_linux_x86_64  =# host build needs no prefix
CROSS_linuxRT_x86_64=$(call BR_PATH,x86_64)

# (you can override 'gcc' by another compiler by setting CC_<arch>)

# CPSW requires 'boost'. If this installed at a non-standard
# location (where it cannot be found automatically by the tools)
# then you need to set one of the variables
#
# boostinc_DIR_xxx,
# boostinc_DIR_default,
# boostinc_DIR,
# boost_DIR,
# boost_DIR_xxx,
# boost_DIR_default
#
# to the directory where boost headers are installed.
# In case of 'boost_DIR, boost_DIR_xxx, boost_DIR_default'
# a '/include' suffix is attached
# These aforementioned variables are tried in the listed
# order and the first one which is defined is used.
# Thus, e.g.,
#
# boostinc_DIR_xxx = /a/b/c
# boost_DIR_yyy     = /e/f
# boost_DIR_default =
#
# will use /a/b/c for architecture 'xxx' and /e/f/include for 'yyy'
# and nothing for any other one (including the 'host').
#
# Likewise, you must set
# boostlib_DIR_xxx, boostlib_DIR_default, boostlib_DIR
# (or any of boost_DIR, boost_DIR_xxx, boost_DIR_default in 
# which case a '/lib' suffix is attached) if 'boost' libraries
# cannot be found automatically by the (cross) tools.
#
# Note 'boost_DIR' (& friends) must be absolute paths
# or relative to $(CPSW_DIR).
